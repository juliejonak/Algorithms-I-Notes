# Find the Smallest Missing Element from a Sorted Array

# Given a sorted array of distinct non-negative integers, find the smallest missing element in it.

## Examples

A = [0, 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15]
# _Output:_ The smallest missing element is 3

B = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15]
# _Output:_ The smallest missing element is 0

C = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# _Output:_ The smallest missing element is 7
